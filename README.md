Features of Industrial interior design

When you think of industrial interior design, you think of raw,  unpretentious and edgy. Maybe you recall seeing industrial styled  interiors in an outdoor commercial area or a cool restaurant. However,  you can also make use of this in your small interior space. Industrial  material is a celebration of the utilitarian material that makes up a  home. And what’s interesting about it is that it can work with any other  style.

In light of the modern design styles, interior designers are now more  experimental and wilder with mixing and matching new techniques. We’ve  recently starting to see wild styles taking over interior spaces and  giving it a special outspoken vibe.

If you desire to furnish your space in industrial interior style then here are the main features:

Industrial Interior Design 

1) Materiality exposure 

If you’ll go for industrial design style, then you’ll not be shy to  expose the materials. This style tends to celebrate the materiality  rather than conceal it. The skeleton of the building, steel or wooden  beams or even unfinished walls, they all serve as piece of art in your  space.

You can use metals like stainless steel, iron, aluminum and copper.  Other materials include glass, concrete and brick Unfinished or  reclaimed wood. In furnishing, leather and linen will be spot on.

2) Neutral colour Palette 

In industrial style, as contemporary style, always keep your colours  neutral. Mainly you’ll be dealing with shades of grey, brown, black and  white. If you want to go bold in certain spaces, then brick red, burnt  orange and dark green would be a good choice. However, it’s better not  to use them all together. Just pick one colour for an emphasis.

3) Bare windows 

A special detail about this style is using the classic industrial  bare window without any shade. The metal framing makes the window pop.  If you have to use window cover, then go for a simple roller shade.

4) Furniture 

Industrial design furniture is mainly large scale, low profile, with  strong and clear lines. Most importantly it’s free from any patterns.  Like the modern style,  the materiality celebration is also shown in furniture. It can include  industrial pipes and metal frames in pieces like side tables and book  cases. Another option for the coffee table can be a large wooden chunk.

5) Flooring 

The flooring materials suitable for this style are polished concrete,  stone and wood. It’s not preferable to use any rugs in industrial  style. However, you can go for a small neutral colored rug to give your  floors a warm feeling.

6) Lighting 

The basic light bulb is the most prominent lighting element in this  style. Particularly use an Edison style light bulb. The concept of  exposure also applies in lighting fixtures. That’s through the special  detail of an open scale cage that shows the bulb’s cool look. Moreover,  try to always include floor lamps, table lamps and pendants. You can add  the studio floor lamp or have a set of hanging bulbs.

When it comes to designing your own space,  then sky is the limit for what you can try and experiment. And that  what makes the whole process enjoyable. What matters the most is  creating a space that reflects your own soul.
